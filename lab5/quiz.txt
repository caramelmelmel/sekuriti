1. False.
Draw the logic table out.
In GF(2) both addiction and subtraction are the same as it is a simple Galois Field with characteristic 2 and by drawing the truth table for its elements {0, 1} for both addition and subtraction we can see that they are exactly the same and corresponds 
to a XOR operation in boolean logic. 

Both 0 + 1 and 1 + 0 results in: 

1 mod 2 which is 1, as well as 0 - 1 and 1 - 0 which results in (-1) mod 2 = (1) mod 2 = 1.

In GF(3) the main elements are {0, 1, 2}, addition and subtraction is not the same as in GF(2). 

The addition in GF(3) produces a more symmetrical boolean table where adding 0 + 1 and 1 + 0, both results in 1 mod 3 which is 1, the same goes for 1 + 2 and 2 + 1 which results in 3 mod 3 which is 0, however in the subtraction boolean table, subtracting 1 from 0 will result in: (-1) mod 3 which is 2 but 1 - 0 it results in: 1 mod 3 which is 1, and we can see that the logic table is more asymmetrical here.

2. True
In modular arithmetics, Addition and subtraction are performed by adding or subtracting two of the polynomials together, and reducing the result modulo the characteristic. 
In a finite field with base 2, addition modulo 2, subtraction modulo 2, and XOR are identical. 
Since here the Galois Field is given as GF(2^N), the base is prime number 2 which is the smallest positive integer p such that p . 1  equals to 0, and with the characteristic of 2, both addition and subtraction is identical.

3. True
GF(2) is the finite field of two elements with its additive and multiplicative identities respectively denoted 0 and 1. 
The elements of GF(2) can be identified with the two possible values of a bit and to the boolean values true and false or {0, 1}. The multiplication of GF(2) on boolean variables corresponds to the logical AND gate, as we can see 0 x 0 = 0 which is equivalent to 0 AND 0, the same goes for 0 x 1 = 0, 1 x 0 = 0, and 1 x 1 = 1.

4. False
In a Galois Field of GF(2^8) the highest order/degree of polynomial is 7. For GF(2^n), all elements are polynomials of degree < n. Elements of GF(p^n) may be represented as polynomials of degree strictly less than n over GF(p). Since here the n = 8, then all elements are polynomials of degree < 8. Rule of Galois field says that for GF(2^n), the number of elements is n-1 

Example: 
In GF(2^8),
P(x)= a7x^7 + a6x^6 + a5x^5 + a4x^4 + a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0

When conducting a multiplication, the reduction polynomial P(x) of the extension field is used to ensure that the result of multiplications stays within the extension field.

5. False
An irreducible polynomial cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials, however the polynomial presented here which is P(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 can still be factored into non-constant polynomials, which are (x^2 - x + 1)(x + 1)(x + 1), thus it is not irreducible and instead is a reducible polynomial
